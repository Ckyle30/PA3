># PYTHON DATA ANALYSIS (PANDAS)

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for data analysis using the Pandas library. The scripts address problems from Experiment 3 of the Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms course.


## Task
1. **Problem 1**
   - **Purpose**: Loads a CSV file into a DataFrame and displays the first five and last five rows.
   - **Instructions**: 
     - Load the `cars.csv` file into a DataFrame named `cars`.
     - Display the first five and last five rows of the DataFrame.

2. **Problem 2**
   - **Purpose**: Performs subsetting, slicing, and indexing operations on the DataFrame to extract specific information.
   - **Instructions**:
     - Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, 7, etc.).
     - Find the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
     - Determine the number of cylinders (`cyl`) for the car model ‘Camaro Z28’.
     - Determine the number of cylinders (`cyl`) and gear type (`gear`) for the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’, and ‘Honda Civic’.
     - 
## How to Use
1. Download the `cars.csv` file from [this link](http://bit.ly/Cars_file) and save it to your default user folder.
2. Run the scripts using Jupyter Notebook.
